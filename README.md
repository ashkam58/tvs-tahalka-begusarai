npm start
```

## Editing Content (No API needed)
- **Bikes:** edit `data/bikes.json`. Add images to `public/bikes` and reference them by `/bikes/your-file.jpg`.
- **Offers:** edit `data/offers.json` (shows on the homepage marquee).
- **Services:** edit `data/services.json`.
- **FAQ:** edit `data/faqs.json`.

Each **bike** object looks like:
```json
{
  "name": "TVS Apache RTR 160 4V",
  "slug": "apache-rtr-1604v",
  "price_from_inr": 130000,
  "engine_cc": 159.7,
  "mileage_kmpl": 45,
  "highlights": ["Oil-cooled 4-valve engine", "LED headlamp", "SmartXonnect (optional)"],
  "image": "/bikes/apache-rtr-1604v.jpg"
}
```

## Notes
- This is an independent dealer website; TVS trademarks belong to their owners.
- Replace `https://www.example.com` in `app/layout.tsx`, `public/sitemap.xml`, and `public/robots.txt` with your real domain after deployment.
- To add **About** later, create `app/about/page.tsx` and link it from the Navbar.
- Keep copy crisp and bilingual where helpful (simple Hinglish works great locally).
